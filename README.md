# NeuralNetworks
Neural networks, also known as artificial neural networks (ANNs), are a subset of machine learning and are at the heart of deep learning algorithms. Their name and structure are inspired by the human brain, mimicking the way that biological neurons signal to one another.

This lectures will explain the differences between the three types of neural networks and cover the basics of Deep Neural Networks. Such deep neural networks,MLP,Hopfield, self-organizing map (SOM) and CNN and RNN and LSTM. also it covers deep learning, learning paradigam and transfer learning too. By prof. hamid Hassanpour
